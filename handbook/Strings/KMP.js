/*
why LPS works

const txt = "abababcababc";
const pat = "ababc";

const lps = computeLPSArray(pat) produces [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]

consider current state:
    i = 4, txt[4] = a
    j = 4, pat[4] = c

    The prepopulated LPS array, where each index is the substring's [0, i] longest prefix-suffix (lps), provides the fall back indexes so that if a match occurs the previous characters of the pattern do not need to be re-evaluated.
        1. The patterned matched the txt until i = 4 and j = 4
        txt = abababcababc
        pat = ababc

        2. there is a mismatch and since j !== 0 there may be a position in the pattern to fall back to so that the characters before it do not need to be re-evaluated.
        j = lps[j - 1] = lps[3] = index 2

        3. 
        txt = abababcababc
        pat =   aba

        txt[4] = a
        pat[2] = a

        A match indicates that the prefix also matches since; 
            1. got to j = 4 in the first place
            2. fall back to j = 2, since lps[3] = 2, which means pat[2] to pat[3] has proper prefix from pat[0] to pat[1]
            3. if pat[2] matches then pat[0] would match too, thefore continue to evaluate pat[3] next

        A mismatch would either require:
            1. if j === 0, cannot fall back any further. i += 1 to try new character in txt
            2. fall back to another previous prefix-suffix. j = lps[j - 1]

        since it is a match so i += 1 and j += 1 to evaluate the next character
